# Contributing to pacman-venv
Welcome! Thanks for considering contributing to the development of **pacman-venv**. This guide contains useful tips and guidelines
to contribute to this project. Testing and coding conventions will be added in more detail in the future.

If you plan on making any changes that might not be fully agreed on, it is recommended to open an issue detailing your ideas first.

Submit all changes to the `master` branch. This allows for separation between new changes and the latest stable release. When submitting a
Pull Request, make sure to add the change/feature to the [Upcoming](CHANGELOG.md#upcoming) section of the Changelog with a reference to the
Pull Request (This can be done after submitting the PR or separately by me).

## Coding Conventions

### Formatting
It is highly recommended to use an [EditorConfig][0] plugin for your code editor to maintain a consistent coding style for all project files.
